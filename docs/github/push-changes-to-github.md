Once you’ve made and committed changes to your local repository, the next step is to share those updates with your remote repository on **GitHub**. This process is known as **pushing** changes.

Pushing ensures your latest work is uploaded to GitHub so that you (and your team) can access it from anywhere.

## What is "Push" in Git?

The **push** command in Git uploads your local commits to a remote repository. Think of it as “publishing” your changes to GitHub.

```bash
git push
```

When you run this command, Git sends your local branch’s commits to the corresponding branch in your remote repository (for example, `main` or `master`).

## Step-by-Step: How to Push Changes to GitHub

### 1. Check your current branch

Before pushing, make sure you’re on the correct branch.

```bash
git branch
```

If you’re on a feature branch (e.g., `feature/update-readme`), Git will push that branch to the remote repository.

### 2. Link your local repository to a remote (if not already)

If your local repo isn’t connected to GitHub yet, add the remote URL:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>.git
```

Then verify it:

```bash
git remote -v
```

You should see something like:

```
origin  https://github.com/ajay-dhangar/introduction-to-github.git (fetch)
origin  https://github.com/ajay-dhangar/introduction-to-github.git (push)
```

### 3. Push your changes

Now that your repository is ready, push your commits using:

```bash
git push origin main
```

or, if you’re working on a branch:

```bash
git push origin your-branch-name
```

**Example:**

```bash
git push origin feature/add-login-form
```

This command uploads all your local commits from the branch `feature/add-login-form` to GitHub.

### 4. Enter your GitHub credentials (if prompted)

If it’s your first time pushing, Git may ask for your GitHub username and a **Personal Access Token (PAT)** instead of your password.  

You can create one by visiting:  👉 [GitHub Personal Access Tokens](https://github.com/settings/tokens)

### 5. Verify your changes on GitHub

After a successful push, go to your repository on GitHub — you’ll see your commits reflected there

You can also check the commit history:

```bash
git log
```

## Common Errors and Fixes

| Issue | Cause | Fix |
|-------|--------|-----|
| `error: failed to push some refs` | Your local branch is behind the remote branch | Run `git pull origin main --rebase` before pushing again |
| `authentication failed` | Invalid credentials or expired token | Generate a new PAT and reauthenticate |
| `remote: Repository not found` | Wrong remote URL | Double-check the repo name and your GitHub username |

:::tip

If you want Git to remember your remote branch for next time, you can use the `-u` flag:

```bash
git push -u origin main
```

Now, you can simply run:

```bash
git push
```

from then on — Git will automatically know where to push your changes.
