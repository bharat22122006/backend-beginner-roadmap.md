Once you’ve made changes to your code and pushed them to GitHub, the next step is to **create a Pull Request (PR)**. A **Pull Request** is how you propose your changes to be merged into another branch — typically the `main` branch.

It’s also where discussions, reviews, and collaboration happen before merging your work.

## What is a Pull Request?

A **Pull Request** (PR) allows you to tell others about changes you’ve pushed to a branch in a GitHub repository. When you open a PR, you’re asking the repository maintainer to review your code and merge it into the main codebase.

:::tip Think of a pull request as saying
  
<q>Hey, I’ve made some improvements. Can you check and merge them?</q>

## Step-by-Step: How to Create a Pull Request on GitHub

### 1. Push your branch to GitHub

Before you can open a pull request, make sure your branch is already pushed to GitHub.

```bash
git push origin feature/add-readme
```

### 2. Go to your repository on GitHub

Open your repository in your browser, e.g.:  
`https://github.com/<your-username>/<repository-name>`

GitHub will often display a yellow bar like this:

> **Compare & pull request** – You’ve recently pushed a branch.

Click on **Compare & pull request**.

### 3. Choose branches to compare

You’ll see two dropdowns:

- **base:** usually `main` (where you want your changes to go)
- **compare:** your feature branch (the one containing your new commits)

Example:

```
base: main ← compare: feature/add-readme
```

### 4. Write a clear pull request title and description

Add a meaningful title and a short description of your changes.

Example:

**Title:**  
`Added a detailed README with setup instructions`

**Description:**

```
### What’s new
* Added a comprehensive README file
*-* Included setup, usage, and contribution guide

### Why
To help new contributors get started quickly.
```

This helps reviewers understand your contribution at a glance.

### 5. Review your changes

Scroll down to see all the files changed. Make sure your commits reflect what you actually want to merge — and nothing extra.

### 6. Create the Pull Request

Click on **Create Pull Request** 🎉 Your PR is now open!

It will appear under the repository’s **Pull Requests** tab, where reviewers can:

- Comment on your changes  
- Suggest edits  
- Approve or request modifications

## 7. Review Process

Once you submit your PR:

- Reviewers may leave comments asking for clarification or improvements  
- You can make more commits to your branch, and they’ll automatically appear in the same PR  
- When everything looks good, the maintainer will **merge** your PR into the base branch  

## 8. Merge the Pull Request

Once approved, the PR can be merged. If you have permission, click:

> **Merge Pull Request** → **Confirm Merge**

After merging, delete your branch to keep the repository clean:

```bash
git branch -d feature/add-readme
```

## Example Workflow Summary

```bash
# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feature/add-readme

# Make changes
git add .
git commit -m "Added detailed README"

# Push to GitHub
git push origin feature/add-readme

# Open PR on GitHub website
# base: main ← compare: feature/add-readme
```

## Best Practices for Pull Requests

* Keep PRs small and focused — easier to review  
* Write clear titles and meaningful commit messages  
* Add screenshots if your change affects the UI  
* Reference related issues using `Fixes #issue-number`  
* Respond to review comments promptly

* Understand what a Pull Request is  
* Create and open a PR on GitHub  
* Write a good title and description  
* Collaborate and merge your changes
